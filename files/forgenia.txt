The universal header " warc.h " shall provide normalised interfaces to enable developers to create valid and compliant WARC - records , based on the definition in the " ISO TC 46 / SC 4 N 595 " standards document . The interfaces shall be made available to create WARC records of the following types : - " warinfo " - " response " - " request " - " metadata " - " revisit " - " conversion " - " continuation " - " resource "
Each WARC - record shall be accessible via a peer C class of the same name .
The attributes of each WARC - record , as per the ISO standard specification , shall have a corresponding attribute in its peer C class .
Each peer class shall expose a set a class functions to read , write , and update attributes for the corresponding WARC - record .
It shall be possible to perform read operations ( read from offset , filters , etc. ) on WARCrecords from a remote location via http .
It shall be possible to specify non-default operations of " arc2warc " using a named configuration file , which will describe the desired ARC - record to WARC - record conversion .
